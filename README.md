# Research Lab Management System

An academic research lab management system for moderate use.

---

## Overview

The Research Lab Management System is a robust web-based platform designed to streamline the operations of academic research laboratories. It centralizes essential lab management tasks, enabling faculty, staff, and students to efficiently track projects, manage lab inventory, schedule equipment, and facilitate team collaboration. Built primarily with HTML (80.9%) and Python (19.1%), this system is optimized for moderate-scale research environments seeking reliability, usability, and security.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/)
- A supported RDBMS (SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- (Optional) Virtual environment tool (e.g., venv, virtualenv)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saimon0007/Research-Lab-Management.git
   cd Research-Lab-Management
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust settings as needed (e.g., database URL, secret keys).

5. **Initialize the database:**
   - For Flask:
     ```bash
     flask db upgrade
     ```
   - For Django:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

6. **Run the application:**
   - For Flask:
     ```bash
     flask run
     ```
   - For Django:
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```

## Configuration

- **Database:** Ensure the database connection string in your `.env` file or `settings.py`/`config.py` is correct.
- **Email Notifications:** Set up SMTP credentials for email-based notifications.
- **Admin User:** On the first run, create an admin user either via CLI or web interface.
- **Static/Media Files:** Configure static and media file locations for file uploads.

## Usage

1. **Access the system:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (Flask) or `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (Django).
2. **Log in:** Use your credentials to log in or register a new account if registration is enabled.
3. **Explore modules:** Use the navigation menu to manage projects, inventory, equipment bookings, and more.
4. **Admin Panel:** Administrators can manage users, system settings, and review analytics.
